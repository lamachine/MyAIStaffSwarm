# Project Status and Next Steps

## Checklist
- [x] **~~Set Up Git Repository: (Completed)~~**  
  - Initialize Git repository if not done already.  
  - Create an initial commit with the current file structure.  
  - Create branches/tags for major milestones (e.g., "initial_setup", "agent_first_run").

- [ ] **Script Startup Tasks:**  
  - Write a startup script (e.g., `startup.sh` or `Makefile`) that:
    - Checks or starts your tunnel host (using cloudflared or similar).  
    - Checks or starts Ollama (ensure it's running locally).  
    - Verifies that all required Supabase containers are running (check using Docker commands).
    - Verifies that all required Dev Environment containers are running (check using Docker commands).
  
- [ ] **Review and Refine File Structure:**  
  - Create or duplicate the first main file (e.g., `main.py`) as the application entry point.
  - Ensure that your file structure separates API code, agents, common utilities, and UI layers.

- [ ] **Get the First Agent Running:**  
  - Integrate local Ollama for LLM responses.
  - Ensure RAG data access is working correctly (e.g., via Supabase).
  - Integrate functionality to add, edit, and delete Google Tasks (use previous version references as needed).
  - Test that the agent can chat (send and receive messages) and process data.

- [ ] **Testing and Verification:**  
  - Send test messages through your ComposerChatLog endpoints.
  - Verify the messages are logged to files and inserted into your Supabase `messages` table.
  - Test Google Tasks CRUD operations through the agent.

## Detailed Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Git Setup & Version Control:**
   - Initialize your repository (if not already done):
     - `git init`
     - Add all files: `git add .`
     - Commit with a message: `git commit -m "Initial commit with current structure"`
   - Create a new branch or tag for this milestone (e.g., `initial-setup`).

2. **Startup Script Preparation:**
   - Create a script (`startup.sh` or a Makefile target) that:
     - Starts your tunnel host (invoke your cloudflared command).
     - Checks that your local Ollama instance is running.
     - Verifies that your Supabase containers are up (using `docker ps` or a custom script).
   - Test these commands individually before integrating them into the script.

3. **File Structure Review and `main.py` Creation:**
   - Review your current file structure.
   - Create a new file `main.py` that will serve as the main entry point. This file should:
     - Import essential modules.
     - Initialize the application (e.g., instantiate any agents, set up routes for FastAPI, etc.).
     - Possibly route to your ComposerChatLog component.
   - Make sure `main.py` calls the startup routines necessary for your environment.

4. **Agent Integration:**
   - Using previous version references for your agents, integrate:
     - Local Ollama connectivity for LLM response generation.
     - RAG data access via Supabase.
     - Google Tasks CRUD functionality (add, edit, delete tasks); integrate the API calls or libraries used in earlier versions.
   - Create or update the necessary agent files (e.g., in an `agents/` directory).

5. **Testing the Agent:**
   - Run your FastAPI app (e.g., via `uvicorn main:app`).
   - Simulate a conversation through your agent (you can use curl/Postman or the updated Cursor integration if available).
   - Verify responses and check that:
     - The conversation logs are written to file (in your `LOG_DIR`).
     - New records are added to your Supabase `messages` table.
     - Google Tasks operations behave as expected.
   - Debug any issues and commit updates as needed.

6. **Iterate and Document:**
   - Keep updating `PROJECT_STATUS.md` with progress.
   - Document issues encountered and how you resolved them.
   - Prepare for the next iteration (e.g., refining the UI integration or scaling up agent capabilities).

*Note:* As you mentioned that you have references for previous versions of the required files, use them to guide the integration of local Ollama, RAG, and Google Tasks support into the first agent.

This checklist and plan should guide your work over the next several hours, ensuring you have a clear view of the tasks and integrations needed to get your system running. Let me know if you need further details on any of these steps.
