## Testing and Documentation
- Write unit tests for utility functions and hooks.
- Implement integration tests for complex components and pages.
- Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows.
- Use Supabase local development for database testing.
- Maintain clear documentation including setup instructions, Supabase schema, RLS policies, and Edge Functions.
- Never delete any items in PROJECT_PLAN.md, PROJECT_STATUS.md, TO_DO.md or similar.  Use strike through instead.
