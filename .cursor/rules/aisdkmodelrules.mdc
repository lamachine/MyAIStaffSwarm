## AI SDK and Model Management
- Use Pydantic for all AI interactions.
- Ensure proper error handling for AI responses and model switching.
- Provide fallback mechanisms when an AI model is unavailable.
- Gracefully handle rate limiting and quota exceeded scenarios.
- Provide clear error messages to the user when AI interactions fail.
- Sanitize user input before sending to AI models.
- Store API keys and sensitive information in environment variables.
