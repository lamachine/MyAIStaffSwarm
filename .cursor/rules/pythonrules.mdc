## Python Rules and Best Practices
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
- Be guided by the Zen of Python.
- Use functional and declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `is_active`, `has_permission`).
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., `routers/user_routes.py`).
- Follow the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.
- Guide development towards object oriented and modular code.
