## FastAPI Guidelines
- Use `def` for pure functions and `async def` for asynchronous operations.
- Apply type hints for all function signatures.
- Use Pydantic models for input validation and response schemas.
- Organize files into exported routers, sub-routes, utilities, static content, and types (models/schemas).
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions and use early returns.
- Use guard clauses and custom error types for consistent error handling.
- Rely on FastAPI's dependency injection for managing state and shared resources.
- Minimize blocking operations by using asynchronous functions for I/O-bound tasks.
- Use caching (e.g., Redis or in-memory) and lazy loading for performance optimization.
