## Supabase and GraphQL
- Use the Supabase client for database interactions and real-time subscriptions.
- Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies for fine-grained access control.
- Use Supabase Auth for user authentication and management.
- Leverage Supabase Storage for file uploads.
- Utilize Supabase Edge Functions for serverless API endpoints when needed.
- GraphQL is not in use yet, but will be added.  When available, use the following rules:
    - Use the generated GraphQL client (Genql) for type-safe API interactions.
    - Optimize GraphQL queries to fetch only necessary data.
